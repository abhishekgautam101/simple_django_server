# simple_django_server
In this programming assignment, I will be implementing a server that allows the user to create a backend and frontend where:
- 1.  An Admin login page 
- 2.  Validate ID and Password 
- 3.  If Valid, redirect to the profile page. 
- 4.  If Invalid, redirect to a Signup page. 
- 5.  Post Login/Signup, display all existing User ID on profile page using a dropdown list. 
- 6.  Delete button to delete the selected User ID from the database. 
- 7.  Logout. (Where all users are treated as admin)
