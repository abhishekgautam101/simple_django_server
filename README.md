# simple_django_server
In this programming assignment, I will be implementing a server that allows the user to create a backend and frontend where:
- An Admin login page 
- Validate ID and Password 
- If Valid, redirect to the profile page. 
- If Invalid, redirect to a Signup page. 
- Post Login/Signup, display all existing User ID on profile page using a dropdown list. 
- Delete button to delete the selected User ID from the database. 
- Logout. (Where all users are treated as admin)
